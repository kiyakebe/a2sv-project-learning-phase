# Contact Form

This project is a fully functional contact form built using React, TypeScript, and several additional libraries to provide robust form validation, responsive design, and user feedback. 

## Features

- **Form Validation**: Leveraging `react-hook-form` with `zod` for schema validation ensures that users submit only valid data.
- **Custom Error Messages**: Displays specific error messages based on validation rules to guide users in completing the form correctly.
- **Responsive Design**: The form is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Toast Notifications**: Upon successful form submission, users receive immediate feedback through `react-toastify` notifications.
